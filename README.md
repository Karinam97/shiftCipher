# A Shift Cipher

## Aim 
> This project was created for JavaScript learning purposes

## Information
> The project idea was borrowed from CodeCademy. Initially it had to be implemented purely in JavaScript, to learn how to use Classes. However, I have added some user interface and turned it to webpage, and added interactivity to it, using encrypting and decrypting functionalities. 

## Features 
- Words or any string can be encrypted or decrypted by shifting value forward or backward only in alphabhetical order using ASCII code
- Any other characters are not encrypted and stays the same
- Interactivity has been added to arrows which are used to change shift value from 0 to 25 
- It has simple design
